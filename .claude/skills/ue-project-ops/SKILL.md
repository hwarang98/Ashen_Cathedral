# UE Project Operations Dashboard

**Version**: 1.0.0
**Issue**: #5539
**Purpose**: Unified project infrastructure dashboard covering World Partition, DDC, and Source Control health

---

## Auto-Execution Instructions

> **CRITICAL**: When this skill is loaded, Claude **MUST execute the dashboard workflow automatically**.
> Do NOT just display documentation - actually run the MCP tools!

### Execution Requirements

1. **Parse scope** from argument (full dashboard or specific domain: `--wp`, `--ddc`, `--sc`)
2. **Execute all applicable domain checks** sequentially
3. **Score each domain** (Healthy/Warning/Critical)
4. **Generate unified dashboard report** with overall infrastructure grade and action items

    "--sc":  ["sc"],                 # Source Control only
}
```

## Workflow

### Step 0: Server Readiness

Call `ue_check_health()` to verify MCP server is connected and project path is valid.

**Extract from response**:
- `status` - Must be "healthy" to proceed
- `project_path` - Used as `project_root` for subsequent calls

**If unhealthy**: Stop and report connection issue. Do not proceed with domain checks.

### Step 1: World Partition Status (WP)

> Skip if scope excludes `wp`.

#### 1A: Get WP Overview

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="wp_get_status", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- WP enabled/disabled
- Grid cell count and loaded cell count
- Streaming state
- Data layer information

#### 1B: HLOD Status

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="wp_get_hlod_status", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- HLOD build status (up-to-date / stale / missing)
- HLOD layer count
- Last build timestamp

#### 1C: Data Layers

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="wp_list_data_layers", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Data layer names and types
- Active/inactive layers
- Layer asset counts

#### 1D: Cell Validation (optional, if WP enabled)

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="wp_validate_cells", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Invalid cell count
- Validation warnings/errors

**WP Scoring**:
- Healthy: WP enabled, cells valid, HLOD up-to-date
- Warning: HLOD stale (>24h) or minor validation warnings
- Critical: WP enabled but cells invalid, HLOD missing, or errors detected
- N/A: WP not enabled in project (report as informational)

### Step 2: DDC Health (DDC)

> Skip if scope excludes `ddc`.

#### 2A: DDC Health Overview

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="ddc_get_health", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Overall DDC status
- Active tiers (Local, ZenLocal, Shared, Cloud, Pak, EnginePak, Root)
- Any error states

#### 2B: Cache Hit Rate

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="ddc_get_hit_rate", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Hit rate percentage per tier
- Total requests vs hits
- Miss rate trends

#### 2C: Cache Size Estimation

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="ddc_estimate_size", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Estimated cache size per tier
- Disk usage warnings

#### 2D: Tier Configuration

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="ddc_get_tier_config", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>",
    "tier": "Local"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Tier configuration details
- Path, max size, read/write policy

#### 2E: Boot Stats

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="ddc_get_boot_stats", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Boot-time DDC population duration
- Assets loaded from cache vs generated

**DDC Scoring**:
- Healthy: Hit rate >80%, all tiers operational, cache size within limits
- Warning: Hit rate 50-80%, or cache nearing capacity
- Critical: Hit rate <50%, tier errors, or cache overflow

### Step 3: Source Control Status (SC)

> Skip if scope excludes `sc`.

#### 3A: SC Provider Status

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="sc_get_status", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Provider type (Perforce, Git, SVN, None)
- Connection status (connected/disconnected)
- Workspace/depot info

#### 3B: Pending Changes

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="sc_get_opened", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Number of opened/modified files
- File types breakdown (code, assets, configs)
- Files checked out by others (lock conflicts)

#### 3C: Changelist Info (if applicable)

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="sc_get_changelist", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>",
    "changelist": "default"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Changelist description
- File count
- Pending vs submitted status

#### 3D: Change Impact Analysis

```python
ue_manage_project_ops(operation="sc_get_change_impact", params={
    "project_root": "<project_path>"
})
```

**Extract from response**:
- Impacted modules/plugins
- Dependent asset count
- Risk assessment

**SC Scoring**:
- Healthy: Connected, no conflicts, pending changes under control (<50 files)
- Warning: Connected but many pending changes (50-200) or minor conflicts
- Critical: Disconnected, unresolved conflicts, or lock conflicts on critical assets

### Overall Grade Calculation

| Grade | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| A | All 3 domains Healthy |
| B | 2 Healthy, 1 Warning (or N/A) |
| C | 1+ Warning, 0 Critical |
| D | 1 Critical |
| F | 2+ Critical |

---

## Error Recovery

| Error | Cause | Fallback |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ue_check_health` fails | MCP server not connected | Report connection error, provide `.mcp.json` troubleshooting steps |
| WP operations return "not enabled" | Project does not use World Partition | Mark WP as N/A, skip WP checks, continue with DDC + SC |
| DDC tier not found | Tier not configured in project | Report available tiers from `ddc_get_health`, skip missing tier details |
| SC provider "None" | No source control configured | Mark SC as N/A with recommendation to set up version control |
| SC connection timeout | Perforce server unreachable | Report last known status if cached, suggest checking P4 connection settings |
| `ddc_get_hit_rate` returns empty | No DDC activity yet (fresh project) | Report "No data - run Editor to populate DDC statistics" |
| `wp_validate_cells` timeout | Very large world with many cells | Use `timeout` parameter with higher value, or skip validation with note |

## Evaluation Criteria

### Activation Test Cases

**Positive (6)** - Should activate:
1. "프로젝트 인프라 상태 확인해줘" -> Activate (full dashboard)
2. "How is my project infrastructure?" -> Activate (full dashboard)
3. "DDC 캐시 상태 확인" -> Activate (DDC scope)
4. "World Partition status" -> Activate (WP scope)
5. "소스 컨트롤 상태" -> Activate (SC scope)
6. "Project ops dashboard" -> Activate (full dashboard)

**Negative (3)** - Should NOT activate:
1. "프로젝트 건강 검진" -> Use ue-audit skill (project-wide health, not infrastructure)
2. "빌드 에러 해결해줘" -> Use ue-debug skill
3. "DDC 캐시 비워줘" -> Direct MCP call `ue_manage_project_ops(operation="ddc_clear_tier")`, not a dashboard query

### Quantitative Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Server readiness check | 100% |
| WP status detection accuracy | >90% |
| DDC health parsing accuracy | >90% |
| SC provider detection | 100% |
| Full dashboard time | <30 seconds |
