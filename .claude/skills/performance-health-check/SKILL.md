name: performance-health-check
description: "Purpose: project-wide static health audit. 5-category analysis (Blueprint Health, C++ Architecture, Memory/Performance, Build Time, Epic Standards) with priority ranking and trend tracking. Not for runtime .utrace profiling (use insights-profiler). Triggers: '프로젝트 건강도', 'optimization opportunities', 'Epic standards violations', 'performance analysis', '빌드 시간 분석'."

## 📊 6 Analysis Categories (5→6 Expanded) 🆕

### 1. Blueprint Health

**What it checks**:

- Mega-functions (>50 nodes)
- High complexity (execution wire density)
- Unused variables/functions
- Naming violations

**Example Output**:

```text
🔵 Blueprint Health (15 issues)
High: BP_GameMode::BeginPlay - 152 nodes
Medium: BP_WeaponBase - Missing BP_ prefix
```

---

### 2. C++ Architecture

**What it checks**:

- Cyclic dependencies
- Include bloat (>20 includes)
- Large classes (>1000 lines)
- UPROPERTY violations

**Example Output**:

```text
⚙️ C++ Architecture (23 issues)
High: Cyclic dependency GameplayCore ↔ UISystem
Medium: MyPlayerController.h - 34 includes
```

---

### 3. Memory/Performance

**What it checks**:

- Large assets (>5MB)
- Tick-heavy Blueprints
- Unoptimized loops
- Missing const optimizations

**Example Output**:

```text
🚀 Memory/Performance (12 issues)
High: BP_EnemyManager - 8.3MB asset
Medium: BP_AIController - Tick every frame
```

---

### 4. Build Time

**What it checks**:

- Slow modules (>30s)
- Missing PCH (precompiled headers)
- Unnecessary includes

**Example Output**:

```text
⏱️ Build Time (7 issues)
High: GameplayCore - 47s compile time
Medium: UISystem - Missing PCH
```

---

### 5. Epic Standards Compliance

**What it checks**:

- Naming violations (A*, U*, F*, E* prefix)
- EditAnywhere overuse
- Missing BlueprintReadOnly
- Poor Category organization

**Example Output**:

```text
✅ Epic Standards (35 issues)
High: EMyEnum → ELC_MyEnum (Epic naming)
Medium: 23 UPROPERTY missing Category
```

---

### 6. VFX Health (Niagara) 🆕

**Tool**: `ue_manage_niagara(operation="search_systems")` + `ue_manage_niagara(operation="get_parameters")`

**What it checks**:

- Excessive particle count (>1000/system)
- GPU-heavy simulation settings
- Missing LOD configurations
- Overdraw issues
- Memory-intensive emitters

```python
# VFX 시스템 검색
ue_manage_niagara(
    operation="search_systems",
    params={"pattern": "*"}
)

# 파라미터 분석
ue_manage_niagara(
    operation="get_parameters",
    params={"system_name": "NS_Fire_Large"}
)
```

**Example Output**:

```text
🎆 VFX Health (8 issues)
High: NS_Explosion_Epic - 5,000 particles (>1000 limit)
High: NS_Rain_Heavy - GPU simulation, no LOD
Medium: NS_Fire_Large - Missing distance culling
Low: NS_Sparks - Consider GPU→CPU for low-count
```

**VFX Performance Thresholds**:

| Metric | Warning | Critical |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Particle Count | >500 | >1000 |
| GPU Emitters | >3/scene | >5/scene |
| Overdraw | >4x | >8x |
| Memory | >50MB | >100MB |

## Error Recovery

| Error | Cause | Recovery |
|-------|-------|----------|
| `ue_search_assets returns 0 for Blueprint type` | Project has no Blueprints or asset registry not loaded | Run `ue_cache_control(clear_all)` then retry; verify project path with `ue_check_health` |
| `ue_manage_niagara timeout on large project` | Too many Niagara systems (>100) | Use `search_systems` with specific pattern filter instead of wildcard `*` |
| `Build time estimation inaccurate` | Missing UBT timing data | Run a full build first to generate timing data in `Saved/Logs/` |
