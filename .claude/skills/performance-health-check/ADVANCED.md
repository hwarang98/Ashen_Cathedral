# Performance Health Check - Advanced Features

Advanced usage, trend tracking, and integration patterns.

---

## 📈 Weekly Trend Tracking

### Automatic History Saving

**How it Works**:

1. Each health check saves results to `.narshamcp-mcp-mcp/health_reports/`
2. Results stored in JSON format with timestamp
3. Automatic comparison with previous reports
4. Trend visualization (improving/stable/degrading)

**File Structure**:

```text
.narshamcp-mcp-mcp/health_reports/
├── health_check_2025-10-13.json
├── health_check_2025-10-20.json  ← Latest
├── health_check_2025-10-27.json (future)
└── trends.json (aggregated)
```

# Performance Health Check Report

**Project**: MyProject
**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Score**: 72/100

## Summary

Total Issues: 92
- [ ] High Priority: 32 (Fix immediately)
- [ ] Medium Priority: 43 (Address soon)
- [ ] Low Priority: 17 (Consider for future)

## Cyclic Dependency Graph

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[GameplayCore] --> B[UISystem]
    B --> A
    style A fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
    style B fill:#f99,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## Recommendations

### High Priority

- [ ] Fix cyclic dependency: [GameplayCore](Source/GameplayCore) ↔ [UISystem](Source/UISystem)
- [ ] Optimize [BP_EnemyManager.uasset](Content/Blueprints/BP_EnemyManager.uasset) (8.3MB)
- [ ] Refactor [BP_GameMode::BeginPlay](Content/Blueprints/BP_GameMode.uasset#BeginPlay) (152 nodes)

## 🔗 Integration with Other Skills

### Error Doctor Integration

**Automatic Fix Workflow**:

```text
1. Health Check identifies 47 auto-fixable issues
2. Suggests: "Would you like me to auto-fix these with Error Doctor?"
3. User approves
4. Error Doctor fixes in preview mode
5. User reviews diff
6. Apply fixes
7. Re-run Health Check to verify
```

**Example**:

```text
User: "프로젝트 건강도 분석하고 고칠 수 있는 거 고쳐줘"

Health Check: 92 issues found (47 auto-fixable)
→ Auto-fix available for:
  - 23 UPROPERTY missing Category
  - 12 EditAnywhere → EditDefaultsOnly
  - 12 Naming violations

Error Doctor: Applying 47 fixes in preview mode...
[Shows unified diff for each fix]

User approves → Apply all fixes → Re-run Health Check

New Score: 72/100 → 84/100 (+12 points improvement)
```

---

### Blueprint Flow Tracer Integration

**Complexity Analysis Workflow**:

```text
1. Health Check identifies mega-function: BP_GameMode::BeginPlay (152 nodes)
2. Suggests: "Would you like me to trace this function's flow?"
3. Blueprint Flow Tracer shows execution flow
4. User understands complexity
5. Refactoring plan generated
```

**Example**:

```text
User: "BP_GameMode::BeginPlay가 왜 복잡한지 분석해줘"

Health Check: 152 nodes, 87 execution wires (mega-function)

Blueprint Flow Tracer: Analyzing execution flow...
→ 3 major sections:
  1. Player State Creation (45 nodes)
  2. Game Rules Initialization (62 nodes)
  3. Match Timer Setup (45 nodes)

Recommendation:
- Extract each section to helper functions
- Reduce BeginPlay to 3 function calls (6 nodes)
- Estimated new complexity: 6 nodes (96% reduction)
```

---

### Module Mapper Integration

**Dependency Fix Workflow**:

```text
1. Health Check detects cyclic dependency: GameplayCore ↔ UISystem
2. Suggests: "Would you like dependency analysis?"
3. Module Mapper shows full dependency chain
4. Identifies shared interfaces to extract
5. Generates refactoring plan
```

**Example**:

```text
User: "GameplayCore와 UISystem 순환 의존성 해결 방법 알려줘"

Module Mapper: Analyzing dependency chain...

Current:
  GameplayCore → UISystem (needs IGameStateUI interface)
  UISystem → GameplayCore (needs UGameplayManager)

Solution: Extract shared interfaces to "GameplayInterfaces" module

New structure:
  GameplayCore → GameplayInterfaces
  UISystem → GameplayInterfaces
  (No cyclic dependency)

[Shows .Build.cs diff for all 3 modules]
```

## 🎯 Priority Ranking System

### How Priorities are Assigned

**High Priority Criteria**:

- Cyclic dependencies (always high)
- Mega-functions >100 nodes
- Assets >10MB
- Compile time >60s per module
- Critical Epic standards violations (naming, EditAnywhere on components)

**Medium Priority Criteria**:

- Functions 50-100 nodes
- Assets 5-10MB
- Compile time 30-60s
- UPROPERTY missing Category
- Include bloat >20 includes

**Low Priority Criteria**:

- Functions 30-50 nodes
- Assets 3-5MB
- Naming consistency (cosmetic)
- Optimization opportunities (non-critical)

---

### Custom Priority Configuration

**User-Defined Priorities**:

```python
# .narshamcp-mcp-mcp/config.yaml
priority_config:
  mega_function_threshold: 80  # Default 50
  asset_size_warning: 7.0      # Default 5.0 MB
  compile_time_critical: 45    # Default 30s

  custom_rules:
    - pattern: "BP_Critical*"
      priority: "high"  # Always high priority for critical Blueprints
    - pattern: "Test*"
      priority: "low"   # Test code is lower priority
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

### Analysis Performance

**Typical Times** (MyProject, 1,515 Blueprints + 487 C++ classes):

- Blueprint Health: 3 minutes
- C++ Architecture: 4 minutes
- Memory/Performance: 2 minutes
- Build Time: 2 minutes
- Epic Standards: 1 minute
- **Total**: ~12 minutes

**Optimizations**:

- Parallel analysis where possible
- Cached PDB indices (no re-indexing)
- Incremental Blueprint parsing
- Reuse UBT Manifest cache

---

### Accuracy Metrics

**Detection Rates**:

- Mega-functions: 100% (Blueprint metadata)
- Cyclic dependencies: 100% (UBT Manifest)
- Large assets: 100% (filesystem)
- Naming violations: 95% (heuristic-based)
- UPROPERTY issues: 90% (tree-sitter parsing)
